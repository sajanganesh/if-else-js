// code the change like if I give number as 21, 21 is divisible by both 3 and 7 so it should give Chacolate as answer to me.
// sample inputs and

// for 21 answer Chacolate
// for 15 answer choco
// for 14 answer late
// for 13 answer Not divisible by 3 , 7
// Debug the code and try to get exact solutions with different inputs
